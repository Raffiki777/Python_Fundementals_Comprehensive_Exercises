# Problem - Data Types

In this exercise, you will work on understanding and using different data types in Python: booleans, integers, strings, and floats. Additionally, you will combine these data types to construct a sentence with specific formatting. Follow the instructions to modify `data_types.py` and run the program as described below.

## Instructions

* Modify `data_types.py` to complete each of the defined functions (`boolean`, `integer`, `string`, `convert_to_float`, and `all_data_types`) based on the problem descriptions in the comments.
* Test the correctness of your implementation using the provided test suite.

## To Run

To run the main program, use:
```bash
python3 data_types.py
```

## To Test

The test file `data_types_test.py` includes several unit tests to verify the functionality of each function. You can run them as follows:

1. To run all the unit tests:
   ```bash
   python3 -m unittest data_types_test.py
   ```

2. To run specific tests:
   - Test the `boolean` function:
     ```bash
     python3 -m unittest data_types_test.TestExercise01.test_boolean
     ```
   - Test the `integer` function:
     ```bash
     python3 -m unittest data_types_test.TestExercise01.test_integer
     ```
   - Test the `string` function:
     ```bash
     python3 -m unittest data_types_test.TestExercise01.test_string
     ```
   - Test the `convert_to_float` function:
     ```bash
     python3 -m unittest data_types_test.TestExercise01.test_float
     ```
   - Test all data types together:
     ```bash
     python3 -m unittest data_types_test.TestExercise01.test_all_data_types
     ```

**Note**: At a minimum, your code should pass all unedited tests.
