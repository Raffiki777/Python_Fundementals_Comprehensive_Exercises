# Problem - Making Decisions and Repeating Instructions

This exercise focuses on using control structures like loops, conditionals, and input handling to solve problems in Python. Your goal is to complete several tasks that involve making decisions based on user input and repeating instructions through loops.

## Instructions

Modify `making_decisions_and_repeating_instructions.py` to complete the following functions based on the problem descriptions in the comments:

1. **all_numbers**: Print all numbers from 0 to 4, except two distinct numbers entered by the user.
2. **dog_years**: Convert a dog's age from human years to dog years.
3. **consonant_or_vowel**: Determine if a given alphabet letter is a consonant or a vowel.
4. **month_numbers**: Display the number of days in a month based on the month name provided by the user.
5. **pyramids**: Print a pyramid pattern based on the number of rows entered by the user.
6. **fibonacci**: Generate the next 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, starting from two consecutive numbers entered by the user.

## To Run

To run the program, use the following command:
```bash
python3 making_decisions_and_repeating_instructions.py
```

## To Test

The test file `making_decisions_and_repeating_instructions_test.py` contains several unit tests to verify the functionality of each function. To test your implementation, use:

1. To run all the unit tests:
   ```bash
   python3 -m unittest making_decisions_and_repeating_instructions_test.py
   ```

2. To run specific tests:
   - Test the `all_numbers` function:
     ```bash
     python3 -m unittest making_decisions_and_repeating_instructions_test.TestExercise02.test_all_numbers
     ```
   - Test the `dog_years` function:
     ```bash
     python3 -m unittest making_decisions_and_repeating_instructions_test.TestExercise02.test_dog_years
     ```
   - Test the `consonant_or_vowel` function:
     ```bash
     python3 -m unittest making_decisions_and_repeating_instructions_test.TestExercise02.test_consonant_or_vowel
     ```
   - Test the `month_numbers` function:
     ```bash
     python3 -m unittest making_decisions_and_repeating_instructions_test.TestExercise02.test_month_numbers
     ```
   - Test the `pyramids` function:
     ```bash
     python3 -m unittest making_decisions_and_repeating_instructions_test.TestExercise02.test_pyramids
     ```
   - Test the `fibonacci` function:
     ```bash
     python3 -m unittest making_decisions_and_repeating_instructions_test.TestExercise02.test_fibonacci
     ```

**Note**: Ensure your code passes all tests to confirm technical correctness.
